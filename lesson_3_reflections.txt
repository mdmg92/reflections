When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with others teammates, so we all have access to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I have worked on a version that I don't want others see yet, or
when I want to have my own version of a repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are local copies of a repository on GitHub, clones are local
copies of a repository on my computer and branches are differents
versions of a repository.
I use fork when I want to copy a project of GitHub to a repository of 
mine. I use clone to copy an existing repository on GitHub to my 
computer and I use branches to make different versions of a repository.
