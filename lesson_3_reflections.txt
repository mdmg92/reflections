When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with others teammates, so we all have access to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I have worked on a version that I don't want others see yet, or
when I want to have my own version of a repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are local copies of a repository on GitHub, clones are local
copies of a repository on my computer and branches are differents
versions of a repository.
I use fork when I want to copy a project of GitHub to a repository of 
mine. I use clone to copy an existing repository on GitHub to my 
computer and I use branches to make different versions of a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That when I wish to commit a change to the remote, I won't have many
conflicts between the both versions, since the ancestors of both will
be more "reacheable"

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would ask the owner of the project to send my his repository (like 
via email or something else) and make my own changes to the project. 
Then I'll send back my files with the changes I made, and ask him to
check it out. I don't think there is something easier on doing this, it
will only become harder to collaborate because the owner of the project
will have to manually find and check for the changes I have made, 
notify me via email if he found something wrong and start over again.
