When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on a project with others teammates, so we all have access to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When I have worked on a version that I don't want others see yet, or
when I want to have my own version of a repository.
